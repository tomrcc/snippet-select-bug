This project hosts it's own free Font Awesome icon sets. This means you can avoid setting up your own custom icon kit in Font Awesome. This could be replaced with the basic CDN method of adding Font Awesome icons to your site if you have your own Font Awesome kit. 

The complete icon list is present in the `icons.yml` file. This file contains objects containing an editor readable name, paired with a Font Awesome class that will add an icon to the locations it's added to in the layouts. This icon list can be used to populate CloudCannon input's wherever it's needed.

To add your own custom icons to this list, you can follow the example set out in the top of the `icons.yml` file for the CloudCannon logo. An editor-readable name is paired with a custom CSS class that we add styles to in our `static/css/custom-icons.css` file. Replicate the CSS in that file to add your own custom icons. An example of using an icon is present in our button components

To remove Font Awesome Icons:

1. Remove the `static/fontawesome` directory.
2. Remove `static/css/custom-icons.css` , and the example custom icon `static/icons/logo.svg`.
3. Remove the icon links from the head of your site in `partials/head.html`:
```html
  <!-- Font Awesome icons -->
  <link href="/fontawesome/css/fontawesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <link href="/fontawesome/css/brands.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <link href="/fontawesome/css/solid.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <link href="/fontawesome/css/regular.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <link href="/css/custom-icons.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
4. Remove `icons.yml`
5. Remove any select inputs that were using the icon

```yaml
icon:
  type: select
  options:
    values: data.icons
```

6. Remove icons from your defined data in `cloudcannon.config.yml`

```yaml
data_config:
  icons:
    path: data/icons.yml
```
