Blog section with tags and pagination included. Documentation, blog and other text heavy sections should replicate how the blog section is implemented in this template.

Blog pages in this template use snippets for anything that can't be represented in traditional markdown. Snippets allow you to use HTML components throughout your markdown text.

A common layout, with changing markdown content is favored for these kinds of text heavy pages, rather than using Bookshop components - which are defined and managed in your page's frontmatter. These text heavy pages will be edited in CloudCannon's content editor, rather than the visual editor used for building pages with Bookshop components. This template demonstrates using the content editor inside of the visual editor. It is essentially an iframe to the WYSIWYG editor, while providing the visual editing preview to allow your editors to see what the page would look like before saving (with the caveat that your snippets are not rendered in the content editor).
